The data type which stores the value directly in the memory is called the Value Data Type in C#. The examples are int, char, boolean, and float which store numbers, alphabets, true/false, and floating-point numbers respectively. 
Primitive Value Types:
Numeric Types:
int: 32-bit signed integer.
long: 64-bit signed integer.
short: 16-bit signed integer.
byte: 8-bit unsigned integer.
float: 32-bit floating-point (7 digits precision).
double: 64-bit floating-point (15-16 digits precision).
char: Single 16-bit Unicode character.
bool: Boolean values (true or false).

Access Modifiers

1.public	The code is accessible for all classes
2.private	The code is only accessible within the same class
3.protected	The code is accessible within the same class, or in a class that is inherited from that class. You will learn more about inheritance in a later chapter
4.internal	The code is only accessible within its own assembly, but not from another assembly. You will learn more about this in a later chapter
5.protected internal: Only code in the same assembly or in a derived class in another assembly can access this type or member.
6.private protected: Only code in the same assembly and in the same class or a derived class can access the type or member.
