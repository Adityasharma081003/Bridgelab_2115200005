Introduction to C#
C# is just a simple, secure, robust, portable, platform-independent, architectural neutral, multithreaded, object-oriented programming language with a strong type exception handling mechanism for developing different kinds of applications such as Web, Windows Form, Console, Web Services, Mobile Apps, etc.C# was created by Microsoft in the early 2000s as part of its .NET initiative.

Abstraction from Hardware: C# abstracts away the details of the computer's hardware,
making it easier to write and understand code.
2. Platform Independence: C# programs are compiled into Intermediate Language (IL) and run
on any device with the .NET runtime (CLR), adhering to the "Write Once, Run Anywhere"
principle.
3. Advanced Features: C# provides extensive libraries and frameworks for various tasks,
supports object-oriented programming, and handles memory management with automatic
garbage collection.
4. Ease of Use: C# has a human-readable syntax, strong error-checking, and powerful
development tools that enhance productivity and simplify complex tasks.
